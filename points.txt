you see how we make something the 
approach / understanding the approach is really really important 

here, the way we made ir  is 
we we made the container elements centered by default 
by ,
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

when hovered ,
as we see a magnetic effect is taking place means 
the previous /main button is not chaning rather another 
element is appearing to make that effect so 

that s why we created the before effect
